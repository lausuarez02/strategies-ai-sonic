# Cult of Ronin: AI Agent Repo (strategies-ai)

This repository is responsible for optimizing strategy execution dynamically using AI, predicting the best yield farming moves, performing risk analysis, and utilizing ZK (Zero-Knowledge) computations for privacy. The AI agent leverages machine learning models and other techniques to automate and improve the decision-making process for DeFi strategies.

## Overview

Key functionalities of this repo include:
- **Dynamic strategy optimization**: AI optimizes strategy execution based on market conditions.
- **Yield farming prediction**: AI-based prediction for identifying the best yield farming opportunities.
- **Risk analysis & alerts**: Using machine learning models to assess risks such as impermanent loss, liquidation risks, and more.
- **ZK computations**: Implementing ZK-proof logic for privacy-sensitive strategies (e.g., Noir/Aztec).

### `models/`

- **yield_predictor.pkl**: A pre-trained machine learning model that predicts the best yield farming moves based on historical data and market trends.
- **risk_analyzer.pkl**: A machine learning model that analyzes and identifies risks related to yield farming, such as impermanent loss, liquidation risks, and more.

### `notebooks/`

- **strategy_backtesting.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook to backtest the AI strategies on historical data to evaluate performance.

### `zk/`

- **private_farming.noir**: ZK-proof logic to ensure privacy during strategy execution. This is where Zero-Knowledge proofs are used to hide sensitive data.

### `ai_agent.py`

- This is the main AI execution agent that dynamically optimizes strategy execution, interacts with the models for predictions and risk analysis, and may call Zero-Knowledge computations if privacy is needed.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lausuarez02/strategies-ai-sonic.git
cd strategies-ai-sonic
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Ensure that you have the correct environment set up for machine learning models and other dependencies. Configuration settings can be modified in `ai_agent.py` or within the models themselves.

## Usage

### Running the AI Agent

To run the AI execution agent:

```bash
python ai_agent.py
```

This will trigger the AI agent to start optimizing strategies, performing risk analysis, and making yield farming predictions dynamically.

### Backtesting AI Strategies

To backtest the strategies on historical data, run:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/strategy_backtesting.ipynb
```

This will open a Jupyter notebook where you can test and evaluate the strategies.

### Privacy-Preserving Strategy

To utilize the ZK-based private farming strategy, run:

```bash
python zk/private_farming.noir
```

This will execute the ZK-proof logic and ensure privacy during the farming strategy.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install all required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key dependencies include:
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and predictions.
- `pandas`: For data handling.
- `notebook`: For running Jupyter notebooks.
- `pycryptodome`: For Zero-Knowledge computations.
